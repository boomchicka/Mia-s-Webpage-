    My name is Mia Gamadia, I live in Dallas, Texas but I was born in England. I love traveling and spending time with my family. I love the winter because I love wearing all of my sweaters, drinking hot chocolate, and snuggling with big blankets. My dog, Duke, is a british bulldog, he loves being a protective dog even though he's scared of everything! Being a senior in highschool, I've compiled a list of things I want to do before I leave for college. My list includes going to the Galleria during Christmas, the Dallas Aquarium and Zoo, The Dallas Arboretum during all 4 seasons, and of course attending a Dallas Cowboys Football Game.
